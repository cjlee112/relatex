%% PNAStmpl.tex
%% Template file to use for PNAS articles prepared in LaTeX
%% Version: Apr 14, 2008


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% BASIC CLASS FILE 
%% PNAStwo for two column articles is called by default.
%% Uncomment PNASone for single column articles. One column class
%% and style files are available upon request from pnas@nas.edu.
%% (uncomment means get rid of the '%' in front of the command)

%\documentclass{pnasone}
\documentclass{pnastwo}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Changing position of text on physical page:
%% Since not all printers position
%% the printed page in the same place on the physical page,
%% you can change the position yourself here, if you need to:

% \advance\voffset -.5in % Minus dimension will raise the printed page on the 
                         %  physical page; positive dimension will lower it.

%% You may set the dimension to the size that you need.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONAL GRAPHICS STYLE FILE

%% Requires graphics style file (graphicx.sty), used for inserting
%% .eps files into LaTeX articles.
%% Note that inclusion of .eps files is for your reference only;
%% when submitting to PNAS please submit figures separately.

%% Type into the square brackets the name of the driver program 
%% that you are using. If you don't know, try dvips, which is the
%% most common PC driver, or textures for the Mac. These are the options:

% [dvips], [xdvi], [dvipdf], [dvipdfm], [dvipdfmx], [pdftex], [dvipsone],
% [dviwindo], [emtex], [dviwin], [pctexps], [pctexwin], [pctexhp], [pctex32],
% [truetex], [tcidvi], [vtex], [oztex], [textures], [xetex]

%\usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONAL POSTSCRIPT FONT FILES

%% PostScript font files: You may need to edit the PNASoneF.sty
%% or PNAStwoF.sty file to make the font names match those on your system. 
%% Alternatively, you can leave the font style file commands commented out
%% and typeset your article using the default Computer Modern 
%% fonts (recommended). If accepted, your article will be typeset
%% at PNAS using PostScript fonts.


% Choose PNASoneF for one column; PNAStwoF for two column:
%\usepackage{PNASoneF}
%\usepackage{PNAStwoF}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL STYLE FILES

%% The AMS math files are commonly used to gain access to useful features
%% like extended math fonts and math commands.

\usepackage{amssymb,amsfonts,amsmath}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% OPTIONAL MACRO FILES
%% Insert self-defined macros here.
%% \newcommand definitions are recommended; \def definitions are supported

%\newcommand{\mfrac}[2]{\frac{\displaystyle #1}{\displaystyle #2}}
%\def\s{\sigma}

%% For titles, only capitalize the first letter
%% \title{Almost sharp fronts for the surface quasi-geostrophic equation}

\title{insert title here}


%% Enter authors via the \author command.  
%% Use \affil to define affiliations.
%% (Leave no spaces between author name and \affil command)

%% Note that the \thanks{} command has been disabled in favor of
%% a generic, reserved space for PNAS publication footnotes.

%% \author{<author name>
%% \affil{<number>}{<Institution>}} One number for each institution.
%% The same number should be used for authors that
%% are affiliated with the same institution, after the first time
%% only the number is needed, ie, \affil{number}{text}, \affil{number}{}
%% Then, before last author ...
%% \and
%% \author{<author name>
%% \affil{<number>}{}}

%% For example, assuming Garcia and Sonnery are both affiliated with
%% Universidad de Murcia:
%% \author{Roberta Graff\affil{1}{University of Cambridge, Cambridge,
%% United Kingdom},
%% Javier de Ruiz Garcia\affil{2}{Universidad de Murcia, Bioquimica y Biologia
%% Molecular, Murcia, Spain}, \and Franklin Sonnery\affil{2}{}}

%% PNAS does not support submission of supporting .tex files such as BibTeX.
%% Instead all references must be included in the article .tex document. 
%% If you currently use BibTeX, your bibliography is formed because the 
%% command \verb+\bibliography{}+ brings the <filename>.bbl file into your
%% .tex document. To conform to PNAS requirements, copy the reference listings
%% from your .bbl file and add them to the article .tex file, using the
%% bibliography environment described above.  

%%  Contact pnas@nas.edu if you need assistance with your
%%  bibliography.

% Sample bibliography item in PNAS format:
%% \bibitem{in-text reference} comma-separated author names up to 5,
%% for more than 5 authors use first author last name et al. (year published)
%% article title  {\it Journal Name} volume #: start page-end page.
%% ie,
% \bibitem{Neuhaus} Neuhaus J-M, Sitcher L, Meins F, Jr, Boller T (1991) 
% A short C-terminal sequence is necessary and sufficient for the
% targeting of chitinases to the plant vacuole. 
% {\it Proc Natl Acad Sci USA} 88:10362-10366.


%% Enter the largest bibliography number in the facing curly brackets
%% following \begin{thebibliography}

\begin{thebibliography}{}

\end{thebibliography}

%% Adding Figure and Table References
%% Be sure to add figures and tables after \end{article}
%% and before \end{document}

%% For figures, put the caption below the illustration.
%%
%% \begin{figure}
%% \caption{Almost Sharp Front}\label{afoto}
%% \end{figure}

%% For Tables, put caption above table
%%
%% Table caption should start with a capital letter, continue with lower case
%% and not have a period at the end
%% Using @{\vrule height ?? depth ?? width0pt} in the tabular preamble will
%% keep that much space between every line in the table.

%% \begin{table}
%% \caption{Repeat length of longer allele by age of onset class}
%% \begin{tabular}{@{\vrule height 10.5pt depth4pt  width0pt}lrcccc}
%% table text
%% \end{tabular}
%% \end{table}

%% For two column figures and tables, use the following:

%% \begin{figure*}
%% \caption{Almost Sharp Front}\label{afoto}
%% \end{figure*}

%% \begin{table*}
%% \caption{Repeat length of longer allele by age of onset class}
%% \begin{tabular}{ccc}
%% table text
